# Discovery of equimolar quinary high-entropy hexaborides
Search for the synthesizability and corresponding descriptors of equimolar quinary high-entropy hexaborides (HEB6) illustrated in ExperimentalHEB6.xlsx and PredictedHEB6.xlsx by runnig SearchHEB6.ipynb. The results will be listed in SearchResults.xlsx.

# Details
The synthesizability of equimolar quinary HEB6 samples synthesized by high-throughput solid-state reaction and predicted by SVM.poly model are illustrated in experimentalHEB6.xlsx and PredictedHEB6.xlsx, respectively, together with their synthesizability descriptors.
